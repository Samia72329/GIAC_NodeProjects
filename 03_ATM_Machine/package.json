Upon exceeding this limit, the account is automatically locked for security purposes. The program also includes a feature to detect and handle cases of insufficient balance when users attempt to withdraw amounts exceeding their balance.\nAdditionally, the application provides a fast cash feature for quick withdrawals and a pin change feature for users to update their PINs as needed. These features enhance the usability and security of the ATM machine, ensuring a seamless and secure banking experience for users.",
